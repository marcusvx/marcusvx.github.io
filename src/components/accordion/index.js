        <p>I come from the vibrant city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, where I was born and raised.</p>
        <p>
          I am a proud father of three wonderful children, a devoted husband, and a dedicated enthusiast of music and
          drumming in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my deep-seated passion for programming and technology, I have an insatiable curiosity for the wonders
          of science and the mysteries of the cosmos, especially in the field of astronomy. Each day, I strive to expand
          my knowledge by embracing the opportunity to learn something new.
        </p>

      <AccordionSection title="What are my hobbies">
        <p>
          During my leisure hours, I indulge in playing video games, with a particular fondness for Nintendo, especially
          the "Legend of Zelda" franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music holds a special place as my second passion. Drumming and savoring the sounds of various genres,
          including progressive rock, hard rock, heavy metal, Brazilian music, jazz, and fusion, are pursuits I
          thoroughly enjoy.
        </p>
